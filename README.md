Just some math formula. Mainly those used in finding Project Euler solutions.

[Solved]: Project Euler #1 -> (p1) * Nth partial + (p2) * ((N-1)th partial sum) - (lcm(p1, p2)) * Nth partial sum
Note: May also be solved using modular arithmetic.

[Solved]: Project Euler #10 -> sum(Sieve of Eratosthenes)

[Unsolved]: Project Euler #231 -> Binomial coefficient, Sieve of Eratosthenes, sum(modular arithmetic)
